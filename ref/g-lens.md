# G-lens Solution

**G-lens** is the pioneering solution supported by [FOSPS](./fosps.md) that empowers patients to access trustworthy, personalized [Electronic Product Information (ePI)](./epi.md).

## Purpose

G-lens creates a focused, personalized view of ePI for citizens by adapting content based on:
- Patient health data from [International Patient Summary (IPS)](./ips.md)
- User context and preferences from [Persona Vector (PV)](./persona-vector.md)

## Core Mechanism

The [Focusing mechanism](./focusing.md) is the central process that adapts ePI information without modifying the regulated content itself, using:
- [Preprocessors](./preprocessor.md) for semantic annotation
- [Lenses](./lens.md) for content adaptation rules
- [Lens Execution Environment (LEE)](./lee.md) for personalization execution

## Trustworthiness

G-lens ensures content trustworthiness through:
- [Content Trust Framework (CTF)](./ctf.md) for integrity verification
- [Provenance tracking](./provenance.md) for traceability
- [Audit Log](./audit-log.md) for immutable activity records
