# Example Preprocessors

here are some example preprocessors:

- **[Terminology Preprocessor](https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/preprocessing-service-mvp2)**: finds words in the ePI  matching terms in a termology service, and annotates the whole sentence with the matched term.
- **[Cleaner Preprocessor](https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/preprocessing-service-cleaner)**: simplifies HTML tags, removes unused `HtmlElementLink`, and removes `style` attributes. Optimizing the rest of the focusing process.
